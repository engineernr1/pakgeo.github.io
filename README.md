# Landing page Geology of Pakistan

This is a small static website template to present books, articles, sketches, and photographs.

## Files
- `index.html` — main landing page
- `assets/styles.css` — styles
- `assets/script.js` — tiny JS for gallery modal and mobile menu
- `assets/` — place images and PDF files here (see suggestions below)

## Suggested asset filenames (place inside `assets/`)
- `profile.jpg` — portrait used in hero (180×180 or larger, square)
- `book1-cover.jpg` `book1.pdf` — cover image and PDF for book 1
- `book2-cover.jpg` `book2.pdf` — second book
- `article-2023.pdf`, `article-2018.pdf` — articles
- `sketch1.jpg`, `sketch1-thumb.jpg`, ... — sketches and thumbnails
- `photo1.jpg`, `photo1-thumb.jpg`, ... — photos and thumbnails

Thumbnail recommendation: 400×300 (or 120–240px wide for small thumbs) saved as JPEG optimized for web.

## Customization tips
- Replace placeholder text (name, bio, email) with real content.
- To change the accent color, edit `--accent` in `assets/styles.css`.
- Swap Google Fonts or remove the link if you prefer local fonts.

## Accessibility & metadata
- Images include alt attributes — replace them with descriptive alt text.
- The page includes basic JSON-LD Person schema in the head. Edit the properties as needed.

## Deploying on GitHub Pages
If your repository is named `engineernr1.github.io`, simply push these files to the repository's `main` (or default) branch — GitHub Pages will publish the site at:
https://engineernr1.github.io/

If your repo has a different name, enable Pages in repository Settings and point to the branch/folder where these files are located.

## Want me to push these files to the repo?
I can create and push these files for you (or open a PR). Tell me:
- Do you want the files added to `main` branch of `engineernr1/pakgeo.github.io`?
- Or would you prefer a new branch and a pull request?
- Any special file names or content you'd like preset (author name, email, a few real book titles)?
